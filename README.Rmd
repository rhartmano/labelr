labelr is an R package that supports creation and use of three classes of 
data.frame labels, the last of which comes in three flavors.

1. **Frame labels** - Each data.frame may be given a single "frame label" of 500 
  characters or fewer, which may describe key general features or characteristics
  of the data set (e.g., source, date produced or published, high-level 
  contents). 
  
2. **Name labels** - Each variable may be given exactly one name label, which is 
  an extended variable name or brief description of the variable. For example, 
  if a variable called "st_b" refers to a survey respondent's state of birth, 
  then a sensible and useful name label might be "State of Birth". Or, if a 
  variable called "trust1" consisted of responses to the consumer survey 
  question, "How much do you trust BBC news to give you unbiased information?," 
  a sensible name label might be "BBC Trust." As such, name labels are 
  comparable to what Stata and SAS call "variable labels."

3. **Value labels** - labelr offers three kinds of value labels. 
    * *One-to-one labels* - The canonical value-labeling use case entails mapping 
     distinct values of a variable to distinct labels in a one-to-one fashion, so
     that each value label uniquely identifies a substantive value. For instance, 
     an administrative data set might assign the integers 1-7 to seven distinct 
     racial/ethnic groups, and value labels would be critical in mapping those 
     numbers to socially substantive racial/ethnic category concepts (e.g., 
     Which number corresponds to the category "Asian American?"). 
    
    * *Many-to-one labels* - In an alternative use case, value labels may serve to
     distill or "bucket" distinct variable values in a way that deliberately 
     "throws away" information for purposes of simplification. For example, one 
     may wish to give the single label "Agree" to the responses "Very Strongly 
     Agree," "Strongly Agree," and "Agree." Or one may wish to differentiate 
     self-identified "White" respondents from "People of Color," applying the 
     latter value label to all categories other than "White."
    
    * *Numerical range labels* - Finally, one may wish to carve a numerical 
     variable into an ordinal or qualitative range, such as dichotomizing a 
     variable or dividing it into quantiles. Numerical range labels support 
     one-to-many assignment of a single value label to a range of numerical 
     values for a given variable.


## Installation

You can install labelr like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") # Step 1 to get GitHub version
# devtools::install_github("rhartmano/labelr") #Step 2 to get GitHub version

install.packages("labelr") #CRAN version
```

## Usage

Assign labels to your data.frame, its variables, and/or specific variable 
values. Then use those labels in various ways.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# load the package and assign mtcars to new data.frame mt2
library(labelr)

mt2 <- mtcars

# assign a data.frame "frame" label
mt2 <- add_frame_lab(mt2, frame.lab = "Data extracted from the 1974 Motor
Trend US magazine, comprising fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile
design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models). Source: Henderson
and Velleman (1981), Building multiple regression models interactively.
                     Biometrics, 37, 391–411.")

get_frame_lab(mt2)

# assign variable name labels
mt2 <- add_name_labs(mt2,
  name.labs = c(
    "mpg" = "Miles/(US) gallon",
    "cyl" = "Number of cylinders",
    "disp" = "Displacement (cu.in.)",
    "hp" = "Gross horsepower",
    "drat" = "Rear axle ratio",
    "wt" = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
    "qsec" = "1/4 mile time",
    "vs" = "Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)",
    "am" = "Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)",
    "gear" = "Number of forward gears",
    "carb" = "Number of carburetors"
  )
)

get_name_labs(mt2)

# add 1-to-1 value labels
mt2 <- add_val_labs(
  data = mt2,
  vars = "am",
  vals = c(0, 1),
  labs = c("automatic", "manual")
)

# add many-to-1 value labels
mt2 <- add_m1_lab(
  data = mt2,
  vars = "gear",
  vals = 4:5,
  lab = "4+"
)

# add quartile-based numerical range value labels
mt2 <- add_quant_labs(
  data = mt2,
  vars = "disp",
  qtiles = 4
)

# add "pretty" cut-based numerical range value labels
(mpg_bins <- pretty(range(mt2$mpg, na.rm = TRUE)))

mt2 <- add_quant_labs(data = mt2, vars = "mpg", vals = mpg_bins)

# show or use value labels
head(use_val_labs(mt2), 4)

# preserve labels and then restore (if lost) or transfer
lab_backup <- get_all_lab_atts(mt2) # back them up

mt2 <- strip_labs(mt2) # strip them away

check_any_lab_atts(mt2) # verify that they have been stripped away

mt2 <- add_lab_atts(mt2, lab_backup) # now restore them

get_all_lab_atts(mt2) # show that they are back

# add labels-on columns to the data.frame
mt_plus <- add_lab_cols(mt2)

cols_of_interest <- names(mt_plus)[grepl("am|dis|gear|mpg", names(mt_plus))]

head(mt_plus)[sort(cols_of_interest)]

# show select values with value labels "on"
utils::head(mt2) # head()

labelr::headl(mt2) # headl

# "flab" - "*F*ilter using value *LAB*els"
flab(mt2, am == "automatic" & mpg %in% c("<=20"))

# "slab" - "*S*ubset using value *LAB*els"
slab(mt2, am == "automatic" & gear == "4+", am, gear)

# "tabl" - Produce label-friendly tables
tabl(mt2, vars = c("am", "gear"), labs.on = TRUE) # labels on, sorted by freq

tabl(mt2, vars = c("am", "gear"), labs.on = FALSE) # labels off (default)

# interactively swap in name labels for column names
# (Note: This is a relatively brittle convenience function that will not support
# ... exotic syntax or pointers to objects that exist outside the labeled
# ... data.frame)
with_name_labs(mt2, t.test(mpg ~ am))

# wnl() is a more compact alias for with_name_labs()
wnl(mt2, lm(mpg ~ am * gear))

# wnl(mt2, hist(mpg)) #not shown, but works
# wnl(mt2, plot(mpg, carb)) #not shown, but works

# interactively swap in both name and value labels
# ...note that "mpg" and "disp" would not work in these calls unless we
# ...first dropped their value labels, since swapping out labels for values
# ...amounts to coercing these to be character variables

wbl(mt2, t.test(qsec ~ am)) # wbl() is alias for with_both_labs()

wbl(mt2, lm(qsec ~ am + gear + wt * drat))
```
